# Vote Ready

Vote Ready is a mobile application developed by the students of Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Kottayam under the guidance of Smt. V Vigneshwari (Former District Collector of Kottayam). The app was used to train more than 350 election officers during the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections. The app provided simulations of various incidents that can occur inside the polling booth during the election process and quizzed the officers regarding it. A detailed list of all the users and the points they scored (on the basis of their answers) was extracted and uploaded to Google's Firebase Cloud Platform. The District Collectorate was then given a separate web platform where they can filter, and query this data.
